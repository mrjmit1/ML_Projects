This repository contains solutions, notebooks, and insights for two fascinating machine learning projects: Online Payment Fraud Detection and Potato Disease Classification. Both projects address real-world problems and employ machine learning techniques to derive impactful insights and predictions.

## 1. ðŸ’³ Problem Description
The objective of this project is to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using transaction data. Fraud detection is crucial for securing online payment systems and minimizing financial losses.

### ðŸ“‹ Key Steps:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing \
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) \
Handling Class Imbalance (e.g., Oversampling with SMOTE, Undersampling) \
Feature Selection and Engineering \
Training and Evaluating Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Deceision Tree etc.) \

## 2. Potato Disease Classification
### ðŸ¥” Problem Description
The goal of this project is to classify potato leaf diseases using image recognition techniques. The dataset includes images of healthy potato leaves and leaves affected by various diseases such as late blight.

ðŸ“‹ Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing (Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation) \
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on image distributions \
Building and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification \
Fine-tuning the model for better accuracy \
Evaluating Performance \
